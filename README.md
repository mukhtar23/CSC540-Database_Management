# CSC540-Database_Management
NC State University. CSC 505 Database Management Concepts and Systems class

Database Class Project (CSC 540)

Me and 3 other students were tasked with designing and implementing a database system for a hospital. The system was designed for the management of the hospital. You could add patients, assign beds and wards, create and manage medical records, check them in and out, and assign treatments to the patients. You are also able to create different staff members like doctors and nurses and assign them to different jobs within the hospital.

The code was connected to a MariaDB database provided to us by the professor of the class (This means that the code will not work since you won't be able to connect to the db). We used JDBC to connect the java code and the database. Also, the UI for the project was just using the command prompt, so all the interaction with the system is through menu input.
